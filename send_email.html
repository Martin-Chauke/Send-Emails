    <p>Wonderful greetings to you! This message addresses the most critical and community problems that we as youth
        need  to solve. We are the solutions for tomorrow. The most critical thing that we need to consider now is the ability 
        to identify problems and be able to propose solutions and voluntarily contribute to the societal growth and development.
    </p>

        There is a wide spectrum of challenges that slow the growth of humanity. These range from climate problems, environmental 
        challenges, economic challenges , health problems, lack of local talent empowerment, Business promotion and financial StartUP
        support. Breaking down these challenges and taking necessary steps to tackle with each problem can make a huge difference. 
        Curiosity plays a pivotal role when it comes to identifying these drawbacks.
